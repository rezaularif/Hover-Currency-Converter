## FAQ

### Why does the extension need access to websites?
To detect currency amounts you hover over and show the converted value. Detection happens locally in your browser.

### What permissions does the extension use?
- `storage`: saves settings and caches exchange rates locally
- `sidePanel`: provides the settings / quick converter side panel
- Host access to the currency API domains: downloads public exchange-rate JSON

Details: `PERMISSIONS_JUSTIFICATION.md`

### Does the extension collect my data?
No. See `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`.

### Exchange rates look outdated—what should I do?
Rates are cached for about an hour. Try waiting, or disable/enable the extension, or restart Chrome to refresh.
